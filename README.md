# Redux workshop

This project was bootstrapped using `vite`.

### Getting started

First and foremost you'll need to have `node` (this is using the LTS version, `16.13.0` as time of this writing) and `yarn` installed in your system. Once you're done with that, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Run the dev server:

```
yarn dev
```

And that's all.
